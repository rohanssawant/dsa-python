## Recursion

One way to do repetition in a program is by using `loops` like for-loop, while-loop.
An entire different approach to achieve this is using `recursion`.

It is a technique in which a function calls itself once or more than once during execution or a data structure which relies upon smaller instances of the same data structure.

Examples of recursion:

- Factorial function: Mathematical denoted as `n!` which has natural recursive defination.
- Binary search: An algorithm which allows us to search for a desired value.
- File system: A computer file system with recursive directories structure.

A recursive definition contains, one or more base cases and one or more recursive cases.
